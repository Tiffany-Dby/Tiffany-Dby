## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª About me

My name is Tiffany Dbeissy, I'm 29 years old, and I'm a Web Developper located in Bordeaux - I do not drink wine though.

I've always been interested in technologies since I'm little. One day, as I was wondering what I could do for living, I decided, out of curiousity, to check how websites were made. Man, I fell in love, this was so interesting that I went deeper and started to learn by making projects and testing things left and right.

I was set, this was what I wanted to do with my life.

## üõ†Ô∏è Experiences

  üöÄ __Currently - I'm seeking an apprenticeship opportunity as a Web Developper to continue my studies as 3rd degree Bachelor in [Sup de Vinci](https://www.supdevinci.fr/) school.__
